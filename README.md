Welcome! This repository contains the code, documentation, and findings from my Master’s dissertation on the impact of weather conditions on household energy consumption. Through this project, I aimed to explore how different weather factors like temperature, humidity, and wind speed influence energy usage and to develop predictive models that can help optimize energy efficiency in residential settings.

1. Overview
This research investigates how weather variability affects household energy use. I used machine learning techniques to create predictive models and identified critical insights on the ways weather conditions impact energy demands. My findings can be valuable for developing smart home energy solutions and energy management strategies that adapt to weather changes.

2. Project Objectives
The project’s goals were:
Identify how specific weather conditions impact energy consumption in residential buildings.
Develop predictive models (including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks) to accurately forecast energy usage.
Assess the performance of these models to determine which provides the most reliable predictions.
Generate actionable insights for smarter energy management and environmental impact reduction.

3. Dataset
The analysis was conducted using the “Smart Home Dataset with Weather Information” from Kaggle, which includes detailed records on energy usage across various appliances and weather data like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

4. Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:
data/: Contains the data files (or links to the dataset if they can't be shared directly).
code/: Includes all Python and Jupyter Notebook files used for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, objectives, and instructions for running the code.

5. Key Findings
Through this project, I discovered:
Temperature is the most influential weather factor affecting energy consumption, especially during extreme temperatures.
Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) provided the best predictive performance, with Random Forest explaining 97% of the variance in energy consumption.
Seasonal variations have a strong influence, with energy demands peaking in summer (for cooling) and winter (for heating).
